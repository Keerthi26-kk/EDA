Amazon Sales Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes Amazon Sales Data to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The goal is to understand:

✅ How pricing and discounts affect sales
✅ Which product categories generate the most revenue
✅ How customer ratings influence buying behavior
✅ Seasonal trends in sales performance

By leveraging Python and data visualization, this analysis helps businesses make data-driven decisions.
